Now you can add Podcasts with the Clarity Podcasts Custom Post Type (CPT) plugin

== Description ==

This is a plugin that adds a Podcasts Custom Post Type (CPT) that allows you the opportunity to post Podcasts to your website, separate from your blog posts.

**What's included**

With the Clarity Podcasts plugin, the Podcasts CPT gets created with the following options for each podcast you add.

- Title and description
- A category selector for the type of podcast (ie: *Short Story*)
- Featured image
- Podcast length, release date and iTunes URL options

The three *theme template files* required are also included so you can customize as you see fit.

And there is a `style.css` file for you to change the design 

### How to add the template files to your theme

Copy the three files from the plugin folder's `templates` folder and put them into your current theme's folder. 

### Theme support

Currently, the [Clarirty](http://www.madebyguerrilla.com/clarity-wordpress-theme) WordPress theme is the first to adopt this plugin so it will work perfect right out of the box. *see screenshots*

As more theme authors adopt this plugin for their themes, I will add them here.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. The `/templates/` folder has the sample theme files needed, which you copy to your theme folder and edit as needed.

== Screenshots ==

1. The admin panel option for you to view, or add new podcast in it's own custom post type.
2. This is a screenshot of the backend options built into the Podcasts custom post type.
3. In your admin panel sidebar, this is what you will see
